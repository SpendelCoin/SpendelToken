  <!-- Spendel's Origin Story -->
  <h2>The Origin of Spendel</h2>
  <p>
    Spendel wasn’t built in a lab. She was handmade — carefully crafted by a talented teen,
    then sold at a youth camp fundraiser craft show. Her shape was unique, and her eyes were curious.
    Her legs dangled, as if they had somewhere to go. So, we brought her home.
    <br><br>
    Soon, everyone who saw her wanted her, but we were not willing to let go... so we began thinking of a name for her.
    We thought of several names, but the one we landed on was Spendel!
    <br><br>
    Today, Spendel lives on as possibly the world’s first handmade meme, and maybe the world will agree that
    Spendel is the coolest meme on the planet!
