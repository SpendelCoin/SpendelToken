  <h1>Welcome to Spendel</h1>
  <p>The Coolest Meme on the Planet</p>

  <p>
    Spendel wasn‚Äôt coded in a lab or imagined by a brand ‚Äî she was handmade. Carefully crafted by a talented teen and sold at a youth camp craft fundraiser, her shape was unique, and her legs dangled like they had somewhere to go. So, we brought her home. And soon, everyone who saw her wanted her. But we weren‚Äôt willing to let go.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we named her Spendel. And now, she lives on as possibly the world‚Äôs first handmade meme. Spendel was brought on-chain not because of hype ‚Äî but because she‚Äôs cool. She represents a vision for what meme coins *could* be: fair, decentralized, and owned by everyone, everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spendel launched with no presale. No dev wallets. Liquidity is locked for a year. The contract is renounced. No hidden tricks ‚Äî just vibes, transparency, and a frog that could go anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our hope is that Spendel tokens get spread widely, so we don‚Äôt see extreme price swings or whales dominating. We know some may gain more than others ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. But we‚Äôre here to build something long-term, where community matters more than charts.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if we can help educate a few people on how to avoid rug pulls and scams along the way ‚Äî even better.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for being here. Thanks for sharing Spendel ‚Äî the coolest meme on the planet. üåçüê∏
