  <h1>$SPNDL – The Coolest Meme on the Planet</h1>

  <p>
    Spendel wasn’t coded in a lab or imagined by a brand. She was handmade—carefully crafted by a talented teen, then sold at a youth camp fundraiser craft show. Her shape was unique, and her eyes were curious. Her legs dangled, as if they had somewhere to go. So, we brought her home. Soon, everyone who saw her wanted her, but we were not willing to let go... so we began thinking of a name for her. The one we landed on was Spendel!
