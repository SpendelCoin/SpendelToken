    <h2>The Origin of Spendel</h2>
    <p>
      Spendel wasn’t coded in a lab or imagined by a brand; she was handmade—carefully crafted by a talented teen, then sold at a youth camp fundraiser craft show. Her shape was unique, and her eyes were curious. Her legs dangled, as if they had somewhere to go. So, we brought her home. Soon, everyone who saw her wanted her, but we were not willing to let go... so we began thinking of a name for her. We thought of several names, but the one we landed on was Spendel! Today, Spendel lives on as possibly the world’s first handmade meme, and maybe the world will agree that Spendel is the coolest meme on the planet!
