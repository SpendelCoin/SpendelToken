  <h1>Welcome to Spendel</h1>
  <h2>The Coolest Meme on the Planet</h2><br>

  <p><strong>🕒 Buy goes live Saturday · 10 AM CT</strong><br>Contract revealed at launch</p><br>

  <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
    Spendel wasn’t coded in a lab. She was handmade — carefully crafted by a talented teen, then sold at a youth camp fundraiser craft show. Her shape was unique, and her eyes were curious. Her legs dangled, as if they had somewhere to go. So, we brought her home. Soon, everyone who saw her wanted her, but we weren’t willing to let go... so we named her Spendel.

    Today, Spendel lives on as possibly the world’s first handmade meme. Fairly launched. Fully renounced. Liquidity locked. No dev wallet. No presale. No hidden tricks. Just vibes. Just frog.

    🌍 One meme. One planet. One community.
